# Ori DE: Seed Generator GUI

## Help
For any questions or issues please post here:
https://github.com/david-c-miller/OriDERandomizerInterface/issues 

## Description
This is a simple GUI that interfaces with the seed generator for the 
\Ori DE Randomizer (https://github.com/sigmasin/OriDERandomizer). This 
uses the current version of seed generator (seed_gen.zip on the 
releases page). It shouldn't be necessary to download this (as it's 
included in the release for this program)

**THE CURRENT VERSION IS v0.7**

## Thanks

Thanks to SigmaSin (https://github.com/sigmasin) for creating the Ori DE 
Randomizer!
